        <section class="lexautolease">
        During my work at Lex Autolease I not only learnt about how they handle their leasing of vehicles, but how they manage their Customer Services and ICT (for example, project design). I spent most of my time with the Customer Services department as well as a day of working in the ICT department as I have a passion for computers. During my time in the Customer Services department I learnt how to handle complaints which allows me to control a situation, during a complaint. I developed teamwork skills as I had to work with my team to assess and tackle complaints.

        At the secondary school which I attended up until June 2018, I ran a club every Wednesday for new students attending the school in the future  so they could feel more comfortable when joining. We would do interactive sessions based on Maths and had students apply team skills to understand mathematical problems. I believe doing this gained me more confidence as well as social and team skills.
