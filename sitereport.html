        <p>Beginning my website was a slow, tedious process due to my lack of knowledge of HTML. During my time working on the index page, I encountered a major problem with the GRID layout on my page. This issue mainly stems from my lack of understanding of how to integrate an image into my index page. Another one of my initial struggles was not knowing all the tags and properties and so on, this made the beginning extremely sluggish due to me constantly returning to websites for better understanding. Another issue I encountered was creating mobile versions of my web pages. This was difficult mainly due to the navigation bar being extremely stubborn and uncooperative. I fixed this issue by using a vertical navigation bar on mobile rather than using a horizontal one like on desktop. Examples of this are shown below.</p>

        </section>  
        <section class="navsolution">
        <img src= "nav index mobile.PNG" alt="Nav Index Solution" >
        </section>

        <p>The portfolio was the hardest page to create due to the grid once again being difficult and causing the paragraphs and images to show in the wrong locations on the web page. This was due to me creating individual sections for the images and text boxes and trying to organise them in the grid that way. To fix this, I had to put the “main” in the grid rather than splitting the main into multiple sections. This allowed me to spread the main across the entire page and then I was able to section off the images and text boxes within that grid space. This can be seen below.</p>

        <section class="portfolioproblem">
        <img src= "porttext example.PNG" alt="Main problem" >
        </section>
        <section class="portfoliofix">
        <img src= "porttext fix.PNG" alt="Main solution" >
        </section>

        <p>Another issue I faced with the portfolio page was, once again, the mobile version. This was due to the images not appearing on screen and the text not staying on the screen either. To fix this, I had to change the mobile version of the web page so that it was not following the same “float” format that the desktop version followed. Instead we had the image appear above the text with the text explaining the image itself. This was due to the same issue I had from the images above, this was fixed via adding “menu” to the grid.</p>
    
        <p>The contact me page was the next page I worked on. Overall, I did not face many issues working on this page. The only issue I faced on this web page was forgetting to use the “mailto” tag to set up the form, initially I was creating the form with no destination. This can also be found below.</p>
